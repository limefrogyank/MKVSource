Broken:
- parse the SPS and PPS from MKV CodecPrivate data
- parse actual height/width/fps etc from stream... OR try to eliminate from stream setup... maybe not necessary.
- do a check to make sure start codes need to be added (check if H264, check if x00x00x00x01 already there)
- speaker setup for AC-3


To Add:
- seeking
- parsing other video/audio codecs besides H264 & AC3
- parsing subtitles!
